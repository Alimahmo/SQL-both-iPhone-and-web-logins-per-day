-- Write a SQL query to count the number of unique users per day who logged in from both iPhone and web,
-- Where iPhone logs and web logs [log-ins] are in distinct relations.


-- iPhone Table --> timestamp | user_id | sessionid
-- web Table --> timestamp | user_id | sessionid


-- The Code:

SELECT  DATE_TRUNC ('day', i.ts) AS day,
	      COUNT (DISTINCT i.user_id) AS num_users

FROM iPhone i

JOIN web w

ON i.user_id = w.user_id

AND DATE_TRUNC ('day', i.ts) = DATE_TRUNC ('day', w.ts)

GROUP BY day
